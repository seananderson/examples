# Talon voice coding grammar configuration files

These are configuration files for [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/), macOS software I use to write code by voice. 

Many files have been modified from the [Talon voice examples repository](https://github.com/talonvoice/examples) and other sources as indicated in individual files. Other configuration files are new in this repository. The [RStudio](rstudio.py) grammar configuration file may be of interest if you use RStudio.

Usage: copy files into `~/.talon/user` as desired.
